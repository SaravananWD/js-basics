# Practice Projects on Vanilla JavaScript

These are some of the practice projects I developed using Vanilla JavaScript with the goal of enhancing my scripting skills. The project ideas were inspired by various sources, which are credited below:

- [Build 15 JavaScript Projects - Vanilla JavaScript Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4)
