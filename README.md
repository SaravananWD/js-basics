# Practice Projects on Vanilla JavaScript

These are some of the practice projects I developed using Vanilla JavaScript with the goal of enhancing my scripting skills. The project ideas were inspired by various sources, which are credited below:

- [Build 15 JavaScript Projects - Vanilla JavaScript Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PHXvlpOkf4)
- [JavaScript 30 â€” Build 30 things with vanilla JS in 30 days with 30 tutorials](https://JavaScript30.com)

You can explore a live demo of these projects at the following link:<br/>
